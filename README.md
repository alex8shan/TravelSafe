# Safe Travel
Have you ever been to somewhere unsafe and wanted to let people you care about to know that you are safe?
This is an app that does exactly that! 
The user can enter the designated location, the estimated time to get there and select contacts to send text messages to.
During the travelling, if the user is in emergency situation, a panic button can tell the server to send the messages early; on the other hand, a cancel button is also provided if the user decide to cancel the text.
